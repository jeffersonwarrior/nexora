  "taskDescription": "Nexora v0.29.3 Development Phase - Implement features #3-7 using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with git branches, comprehensive testing, and production-quality code.\n\nFEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:\n\n1. PROMPT LIBRARY (#3) - HIGH PRIORITY\n   - Database layer with sqlc queries for prompt_library table\n   - Service layer in internal/prompts/service.go\n   - TUI component for browsing/searching prompts\n   - CLI commands: nexora prompts list/search/show\n   - Full-text search using existing FTS5 index\n   - CRUD operations with rating/usage tracking\n   \n2. ABOUT COMMAND (#4) - MEDIUM PRIORITY\n   - Create internal/cmd/about.go\n   - Display version, platform, Go version, license\n   - Community links (Discord, Twitter/X, Reddit)\n   - Repository links\n   - Lipgloss styling\n   - Register in root.go\n\n3. TEST COVERAGE AUDIT (#5) - HIGH PRIORITY\n   - Increase coverage from 29% to 40%\n   - Focus on internal/agent/, internal/db/, internal/session/\n   - Add tests for critical paths\n   - CI/CD coverage enforcement setup\n\n4. TASK GRAPH ENRICHMENT (#6) - MEDIUM PRIORITY\n   - Add dependency tracking to internal/task/manager.go\n   - Visual ASCII graph representation\n   - Progress roll-up through dependencies\n   - TUI task relationship visualization\n\n5. CHECKPOINT SYSTEM (#7) - MEDIUM PRIORITY\n   - State serialization in internal/session/\n   - Auto-checkpoint on context threshold\n   - Manual checkpoint creation\n   - Session restore on crash/interrupt\n\nDEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:\n- TDD: Write tests FIRST, then implementation\n- Git branches for each feature: feature/prompt-library, feature/about-command, etc.\n- Commits to branch with proof of work\n- Run go build ./... && go vet ./... after each change\n- Full test suite: go test ./... -race\n- Target coverage: 40%+\n\nEXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE:\n- Database migrations exist for prompt_library (20251225000007)\n- Task system in internal/task/ (manager.go, service.go)\n- Session system in internal/session/\n- Command structure in internal/cmd/\n- Uses cobra, lipgloss, bubble tea",
