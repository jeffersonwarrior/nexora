## Task Description
Nexora v0.29.3 Development Phase - Implement features #3-7 using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with git branches, comprehensive testing, and production-quality code.

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. PROMPT LIBRARY (#3) - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Database layer with sqlc queries for prompt_library table
   - Service layer in internal/prompts/service.go
   - TUI component for browsing/searching prompts
   - CLI commands: nexora prompts list/search/show
   - Full-text search using existing FTS5 index
   - CRUD operations with rating/usage tracking
   
2. ABOUT COMMAND (#4) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Create internal/cmd/about.go
   - Display version, platform, Go version, license
   - Community links (Discord, Twitter/X, Reddit)
   - Repository links
   - Lipgloss styling
   - Register in root.go

3. TEST COVERAGE AUDIT (#5) - HIGH PRIORITY
   - Increase coverage from 29% to 40%
   - Focus on internal/agent/, internal/db/, internal/session/
   - Add tests for critical paths
   - CI/CD coverage enforcement setup

4. TASK GRAPH ENRICHMENT (#6) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Add dependency tracking to internal/task/manager.go
   - Visual ASCII graph representation
   - Progress roll-up through dependencies
   - TUI task relationship visualization

5. CHECKPOINT SYSTEM (#7) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - State serialization in internal/session/
   - Auto-checkpoint on context threshold
   - Manual checkpoint creation
   - Session restore on crash/interrupt

DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
- TDD: Write tests FIRST, then implementation
- Git branches for each feature: feature/prompt-library, feature/about-command, etc.
- Commits to branch with proof of work
- Run go build ./... && go vet ./... after each change
- Full test suite: go test ./... -race
- Target coverage: 40%+

EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Database migrations exist for prompt_library (20251225000007)
- Task system in internal/task/ (manager.go, service.go)
- Session system in internal/session/
- Command structure in internal/cmd/
- Uses cobra, lipglos
... (truncated)

## Feature Status
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-1: #3 Prompt Library: Database layer (sqlc), Service layer, TUI browser, CLI commands (list/search/show), FTS5 search, CRUD with metrics
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-2: #4 About Command: Create internal/cmd/about.go, version/platform info, community links, lipgloss styling, register in root.go
❌ [FAILED] feature-3: #5 Test Coverage: Audit critical paths, add tests for agent/db/session packages, increase coverage 29%→40%, CI/CD setup
   Error: Worker stuck/unresponsive. Will complete test coverage manually after merging other branches.
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-4: #6 Task Graph: Add dependencies to Task struct, create dependency resolver, ASCII visualization, progress rollup, TUI integration
✅ [COMPLETED] feature-5: #7 Checkpoint: State serialization, checkpoint creation/restore, session recovery, minimal overhead
